# 'SRS' R package and 'q2-srs' QIIME 2 plugin

Scaling with Ranked Subsampling (SRS) is a normalization method for ecological count data (see [Beule & Karlovsky, 2020](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.9593)). 

SRS is implemented as the 'SRS' R package and the 'q2-srs' QIIME 2 plugin (see [Heidrich et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.9593)). Refer to their particular repositories for more specific information:
